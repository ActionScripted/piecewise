# 1. PIECEWISE SYSTEM CONFIGURATION #
#####################################
#
# In this section you will update variables that configure the Piecewise application
# for the remote VM or server.
# 
# Required fields are indicated with the text "# !REQUIRED!" just below the variable name.
# If a field is marked Required, you must enter a value or change the default value.

env: development
# !REQUIRED!
#
# env   Instructs Ansible whether this is a server/VM in development or in production.
#
#       Supported values: production, development
#
#       Use development if you only have an IP address for your server/VM.
#       Use production if you have configured DNS to provide a domain name for your server/VM.

project_name: piecewise
# #DEFAULT#
#
# project_name  
#       The name of your forked repository. This is likely 'piecewise', unless you have renamed
#       the repository after forking it from https://github.com/opentechinsstute.org/piecewise
# TO DO: may no longer be needed. confirm.
#

remote: https://github.com/opentechinstitute
# !REQUIRED!
#
# remote  
#       The URL where your repository is available. You can use any valid git remote. 
#       For example: https://github.com/opentechinstitute 
# TO DO: may no longer be needed. confirm.

piecewise_commit: master
# !REQUIRED!
#
# piecewise_commit
#       Specify any ref (eg. branch, tag, SHA) to be deployed. This ref must be
#       pushed to the remote git_repo before it can be deployed.
# TO DO: may no longer be needed. confirm.

git_repo: "{{ remote }}/{{ project_name }}.git"
# TO DO: may no longer be needed. confirm.

bigquery_project_num: 581276032543
# !REQUIRED!
#
# bigquery_project_num
#       The BigQuery Project Number or Project Name from your project details in the
#       Google Cloud Console at https://console.cloud.google.com
#       This can be the numeric project number or the project name text.

database_name: piecewise
database_user: postgres
database_user_group: postgres
# #DEFAULT#
#
#       These variables define the Postgres database name, user and system group for  
#       the database user. These can be safely left as the default, unless you desire to 
#       change them.

site_fqdn: 35.208.241.53
# !REQUIRED!
#
# site_fqdn 
#       FQDN stands for Fully Qualified Domain Name. 
#       This value should contain either:
#       - the domain name of your production server, ie: www.mywebsite.com
#       - the IP address of your development or production server, ie: 111.222.333.444
#
#       Use an IP address for development, either on a server/VM on our LAN or a 
#       development server/VM on a cloud service like Linode, GCE, Amazon, etc. 
#
#       Once you have the server's domain name in DNS working, you can use it instead of the IP address.

#-------------------------------------------->>

########################
# 1.1 SSL CERTIFICATES #
########################
# The variables in this section will be used to generate SSL certificates. When 
# deploying to development hosts, the country, state and city are used by openssl to
# generate a self-signed certificate. This is useful when you don't have an DNS name
# set up yet and want to deploy using the host's IP address, or to a server not
# accessible to the Internet.
#

site_country: US
site_state: District of Columbia
site_city: Washington
site_ou: Open Technology Institute
# !REQUIRED!
#
# site_contact    These variables are provided to enable automatic generation of 
#     _country    SSL certificates, either self-signed for development hosts or
#     ...         valid certificates through the Let's Encrypt CA for production hosts.

self_signed_ssl_cert_path: /etc/ssl/certs/selfsigned.{{ site_fqdn }}.cert
self_signed_ssl_key_path: /etc/ssl/private/selfsigned.{{ site_fqdn }}.key
# #DEFAULT#
#
# When env = 'development', these variables set the directory on the 
# server/VM where self-signed SSL certificates will be saved. 
# In most cases you will not need to change these values from the default.

letsencrypt_ssl_cert_path: /etc/letsencrypt/live/{{ site_fqdn }}/fullchain.pem
letsencrypt_ssl_key_path: /etc/letsencrypt/live/{{ site_fqdn }}/privkey.pem
# #DEFAULT#
#
# When env = 'production', these variables set the directory on the 
# server/VM where Let's Encrypt SSL certificates will be saved.
# In most cases you will not need to change these values from the default.

#################################
# 1.2 DEPLOYMENT FILE LOCATIONS #

# the remote sytem. These can be largely unchanged, unless your system requires 
# different paths.

# #DEFAULT#
#
# Where the base files from your repo will be copied on the remote server.

temp_path: "{{ base_path }}/tmp"
# #DEFAULT#
#

# like to use in this Piecewise server. 

map_coordinate_southwest: 
  lat: 39.7197989
  lon: -80.519895
# !REQUIRED!
#
map_coordinate_northeast: 
  lat: 42.516072
  lon: -74.6895018
# !REQUIRED!
#
# The coordinates above define the latitude and longitude for the southwest and 
# northeast corners of a bounding box, defining the region from which you are 
# interested in pulling M-Lab NDT data.
#
# These four variables are used to format the variable map_bounding_box below. 
map_bounding_box: "{{ map_coordinate_southwest.lon }},{{ map_coordinate_southwest.lat }},{{ map_coordinate_northeast.lon }},{{ map_coordinate_northeast.lat }}"
# You do not need to edit the value for map_bounding_box.

# !REQUIRED!
#
# map_data_start_date   The range of dates for your server to get M-Lab NDT test data.
# map_data_end_date

# of M-Lab data to test the application.
#
# For a production server, it is advisable to set 'map_data_data_end_date'
# to a date well in the future, for example: "Dec 31 2050 00:00:00".
